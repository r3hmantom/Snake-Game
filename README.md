# Retro Snake Game

A classic snake game implemented in C++ using the Raylib library. This game brings back the nostalgia of the iconic snake game with a retro twist.

## Features
- **Classic Gameplay**: Enjoy the classic snake game experience where you control the snake to eat food and grow longer.
- **Randomized Food Placement**: The food is randomly placed on the game board, providing a new challenge each time you play.
- **Sound Effects**: Immerse yourself in the game with sound effects for eating and colliding with the wall.
- **Score Display**: Keep track of your score as you eat more food and grow the snake.

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys (UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT) to control the snake's direction.
- Navigate the snake to eat the food, indicated by the textured icon on the screen.
- Grow longer by consuming food, but be careful not to collide with the walls or the snake's own tail.
- The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.
- Press any key to restart the game after a game over.

## Development
This game is written in C++ and utilizes the Raylib library for graphics and audio. The code is well-structured, with classes for Snake, Food, and the Game itself. The game loop handles drawing and updating, while event handling captures user input for snake direction.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with modifications, and enhance the game further!
